pdrivep is a rideshare single-page web application. The application uses JavaScript on both ends of the stack. A Node.js backend uses the Objection ORM to interact with the
PostgreSQL database. It uses Hapi as a server. And, finally, it uses Vue.js on the frontend. 

Users can search for a ride by name or destination address, city, state, or zip code. They can also join rides if it has spots left or sign up to drive on a ride if registered 
as a driver. Additionally, a user can see all rides they're signed up for, either as a passenger or driver. From this page, they can also leave a ride as a passenger or driver.
