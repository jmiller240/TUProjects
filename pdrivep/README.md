# pdrivep 

pdrivep is a rideshare single-page web application. It was developed as the final for Multi-tier Web Application Development.

Users on pdrivep can search for a ride by name or destination address, city, state, or zip code. They can also join rides if it has open seats or sign up to drive on a ride if registered as a driver. Additionally, a user can see all rides they're signed up for, either as a passenger or driver. From this page, they can also leave a ride as a passenger or driver.

Tech-stack: PostgreSQL, Node.js, Objection, Knex, Hapi, Vue.js
