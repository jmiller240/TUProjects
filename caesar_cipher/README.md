This is a C program that encrypts and decrypts messages using a circular caesar cipher. It takes three optional command line arguments: a command flag (-d for decrypt, -e for encrypt), a key, and an input file path. It encrypts or decrypts the string from the input file path (or STDIN, if none is given) using the integer key, and outputs the resulting string to STDOUT.
