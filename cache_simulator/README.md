This C program simulates the behavior of a cache memory. The program takes a valgrind memory trace as input,
simulates the hit/miss behavior of a cache memory on this trace, and outputs the total number of hits,
misses, and evictions. It uses the LRU replacement policy when choosing a cache line to evict.
